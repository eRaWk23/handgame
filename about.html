      <h2>What is Handgame?</h2>
      <p>
        Handgame is a traditional Native American guessing game that involves music, strategy, and strong cultural ties. There are many different versions of the game that are played. Just depends on where you are. It's often played during gatherings, powwows, and tribal celebrations, connecting generations through rhythm and intuition. The game is not just a pastime. It's an expression of identity, unity, and resistance, rooted in songs passed down from elders and the spirit of friendly competition.

      <h2>Why This Website?</h2>
      <p>
        I built this site because I grew up traveling to Handgames with my grandparents, and those memories have always stayed with me. Recently I was trying to find events near me and realized how scattered and hard-to-find the information was. There wasn’t a central place with flyers, dates, and basic info all in one spot, so I made one. This site is meant to make it easier for anyone who loves Handgame to stay connected and show up. I want this to be a living project, shaped by the people who use it.

      <h2>Who Maintains This?</h2>
      <p>
        There’s no team, no sponsors, just a commitment to keeping Handgame visible and accessible. Every update and submission is done with respect for the people who keep this tradition going. I welcome help and input from anyone who wants to get involved. Whether it’s sharing flyers, reporting corrections, or helping improve the site’s features, all are welcome. My hope is to keep the site minimal and easy to navigate, especially for elders or those in places with slow internet or limited cell service.
